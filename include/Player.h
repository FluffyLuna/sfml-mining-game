 * @brief Player class handles character movement, mining, and interactions

 * This class demonstrates several key SFML and game programming concepts:
 * - Sprite handling and animation
 * - Collision detection with tile-based worlds
 * - Input handling for smooth character movement
 * - Sound effect triggering based on actions
 * 
 * The player is the main interface between the user and the game world,
 * so this class shows how to create responsive, smooth character controls.
